# Kayla Hurd

👩🏽‍🎓 I am a senior at Georgia State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and set to graduate in December 2025. My coursework has covered core computer science topics like Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, and Computer Architecture. I’ve also explored project-based learning through frontend and backend development. 📚

My journey into technology began with robotics in elementary school, where I helped design and program competitive robots through my Senior year of high school. That hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for how hardware and software work together, and it ignited my interest in building tools that solve real-world problems. I started learning programming basics through Java and Python, and have since expanded into full-stack development.

💻 I’ve built several personal and team-based projects that showcase my growth and versatility as a developer. These include:

- A full-stack **Inventory Tracker** built using React and Supabase, designed to help manage and track equipment across departments at my internship. It features login authentication, live quantity updates, default item handling, past summary saving, and CSV export formatted to match a company Excel template. I also styled the dashboard and created intuitive workflows based on real user needs.

- A **Calorie Tracker iOS App** built using Swift and SwiftUI. This app allows users to create meals by selecting from saved ingredients and specifying serving sizes. It calculates total calories automatically and supports local storage. I am currently expanding it to include repeatable meals and persistent meal logs.

- A full-stack **Real Estate Marketplace Web App** designed to help users post, browse, and evaluate property listings. The platform features a responsive UI built with React, backend services handled via Supabase, and an integrated machine learning model that predicts property prices based on location, size, and other features. The system supports dynamic user flows, real-time updates, and secure data handling.


🎯 Currently, I am a **Technology Intern at LocumTenens.com**, where I independently designed and developed an internal **Inventory Management System** used by my team to track and manage equipment. I’ve also supported the technical side of onboarding, reimaging devices, and troubleshooting issues across departments. Beyond my core responsibilities, I’ve been actively involved in software team meetings and sprint demos to learn more about the development process.

📌 Outside of academics and work, I actively seek growth opportunities. I’ve participated in dev team meetings, shadowed software developers, and explored how tech products are built, tested, and improved in a professional environment. These experiences have strengthened both my technical and communication skills.

Skills

Languages: Python, JavaScript, Swift, HTML, CSS, C#, C  
Technologies: React.js, Supabase, Flask, SwiftUI, AI/ML  
Tools: GitHub, Postman, Figma, Xcode, VS Code, Excel, Azure DevOps  

🏆 My accomplishments include building production-ready tools during my internship, creating full-stack applications from scratch, and taking the initiative to grow beyond my current role. I’m working hard to become a full-time **Software Engineer** — where I can continue to build useful, impactful products and contribute to a team that values creativity, growth, and innovation.
