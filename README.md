## 🌟 About Me  
I’m passionate about creating practical, impactful tools and learning new technologies. My journey started with robotics in elementary school, where I designed and programmed competition robots for years. That experience taught me problem-solving, teamwork, and how hardware and software work together.  

I’ve since built full-stack apps, mobile apps, and AI-powered tools — always with a focus on clean design and real-world usability.
