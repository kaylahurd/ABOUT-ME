# Kayla Hurd

👩🏽‍🎓 I am a senior at Georgia State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and set to graduate in December 2025. My coursework has covered core computer science topics like Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, and Computer Organization. I’ve also explored project-based learning through frontend and backend development. 📚

📑 My journey into technology began with robotics in high school, where I helped design and program competitive robots. That hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for how hardware and software work together, and it ignited my interest in building tools that solve real-world problems. I started learning programming basics through C and Python, and have since expanded into full-stack development.

💻 I’ve built several personal and team-based projects that showcase my growth and versatility as a developer. These include:

- A full-stack **Inventory Tracker** built using React and Supabase, designed to help manage and track equipment across departments at my internship. It features login authentication, live quantity updates, default item handling, past summary saving, and CSV export formatted to match a company Excel template. I also styled the dashboard and created intuitive workflows based on real user needs.

- A **Calorie Tracker iOS App** built using Swift and SwiftUI. This app allows users to create meals by selecting from saved ingredients and specifying serving sizes. It calculates total calories automatically and supports local storage. I am currently expanding it to include repeatable meals and persistent meal logs.

- A **Real Estate Marketplace Web App** developed as part of a team project in my Software Engineering course. Our platform enables users to post and browse properties. I contributed to the UI/UX design using React and helped plan the integration of a property price prediction ML model. We’re using Supabase for backend services and version control via GitHub with regular team commits.

🚀 I am passionate about learning by doing. I regularly sharpen my coding skills through LeetCode (following the NeetCode 75 pattern) and am currently improving my understanding of APIs, authentication, and SQL databases. I enjoy bridging the gap between user-friendly design and technical functionality, and I aim to build tools that are both helpful and visually polished.

🎯 Currently, I am an IT Support Intern at **LocumTenens.com**, where I assist with imaging and reimaging machines, helping both on-site and remote users, and improving internal operations. Beyond support, I’ve taken initiative by building internal apps like the Inventory Tracker and shadowing software engineers to gain insight into Agile workflows and development sprints.

📌 Outside of academics and work, I actively seek growth opportunities. I’ve participated in dev team meetings, asked to shadow software developers, and explored how tech products are built, tested, and improved in a professional environment. These experiences have strengthened both my technical and communication skills.

Skills

Languages: Python, JavaScript, Swift, HTML, CSS, C  
Technologies: React.js, Supabase, Flask, SwiftUI

Currently Learning: SQL, Node.js, Authentication, DSA (LeetCode)

🏆 My accomplishments include building production-ready tools during my internship, creating full-stack applications from scratch, and taking the initiative to grow beyond my current role. I’m working hard to transition into a Software Engineering position — with a long-term goal of working at a company like Apple, where I can keep building innovative and user-focused products. 🍎
